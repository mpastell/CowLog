<h4>About CowLog 3.0</h4>

<p>
CowLog is a software for recording behaviors from digital video developed in the
Research Center for Animal Welfare and Department of Agricultural Sciences in the University of Helsinki.

It is currently maintained and developed in the <a href="http://www.luke.fi/en">Natural Resources Institute
Finland (Luke)</a> and as my personal free time project.
</p>

<p>We created CowLog, because we wanted a free easy to use program for coding digital video.
CowLog is open source software and it is therefore free to use and modify. If you use it for
publications we'd appreciate a citation.
</p>

<p>
  The program supports behavioral coding from multiple videos and
  unlimited number of freely defined behavioral codes and classess. You can
  also choose to use modifiers for behaviors.
